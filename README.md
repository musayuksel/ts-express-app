## Introduction

Welcome to this blog post on building a secure Express.js TypeScript application with AWS Cognito and Prisma ORM. In this project, I had the opportunity to upskill myself in various areas of web development, including Node.js, TypeScript, clean code principles, best practices, AWS Cognito, validation using Joi, ORM concepts, and more. It was an exciting journey of learning and growth!

Throughout the project, I worked closely with my mentor,@robertwilkinson-dev, who provided invaluable guidance and support. With his help, I was able to develop a robust and secure application architecture that I'm excited to share with you.
